Thank you to Ate Meah for helping me bring your flowers to you - I'm so grateful for her, and even more grateful for you. I know we're still at the beautiful beginning of our story, but I already know how deeply I want you in my life. I want to cherish you in every way, to treat you the way you should always be treated.\n\nSometimes I get quiet or awkward, and I worry you might get bored, yet even in those pauses I'm simply taking in how much I adore you. You tease me all the time but it just makes me fall harder. You make me soft; you make me gentle; you make me want to be my best for you. I understand if it's hard to trust when I say I'll be different, but that's okay. I'll show you, little by little, that my love is steady and true.\n\nI can't wait for every laugh, every tiny adventure, every late-night conversation, and even the sleepy silences we'll share. Long distance is new to me, but I'm ready to give it everything because you're worth it. Enjoy your day to the fullest, my love. I love you endlessly. - \"Kiii\""
