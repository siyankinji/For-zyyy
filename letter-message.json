  "birthdayLetter": "I hope you love the flowers I sent you, and I also really want to give a huge thank you to Ate Meah for helping me get them because I’m super grateful for her help. I know bago pa lang tayo and there’s still so much ahead of us, but I just want to say that I’m really in love with you and I truly want you. I want to treat you the way you deserve and make you feel as special as you really are. I know minsan may awkward silences tayo and I hope hindi ka nabobored kapag ganun, kasi ganun talaga ako minsan, but even in those quiet moments I really appreciate every second with you. Kahit lagi mo akong awayin, ikaw pa rin ang gusto ko and hindi ako magsasawa sa’yo. You make me soft and I just want to be gentle with you because you make me feel so much love, and I just want to love you the way you deserve. I understand that when I say I won’t be like the others it might be hard to believe, and that’s okay, because I just want to show you day by day how important you are to me and how serious I am about us. I can’t wait for all the experiences we’ll have together :> the laughs, the small adventures, the simple conversations, and everything else. I know a long-distance relationship can be hard, and this is my first time, but I really want to make this work. I love you so much, and I hope you enjoy your birthday to the fullest. I love you endlessly"
